## Philosophy

The goal of the DoDevops project is to create a collection of useful tools for the global DevOps and Cloud architect
community. While the project doesn't actually have a formal community, we want to ensure a positive and inspiring 
atmosphere in the communication around the development of these tools in issues or pull requests.

This is why we have this Code of Conduct: it explains the type of community we want to have. The rules below are not
applied to all interactions with a simple matching algorithm. Human interactions happen in context and are complex.
Perceived violations are evaluated by real humans who will try to interpret the interactions and the rules with 
kindness. Accordingly, there is no need to hypothesize on how these rules would affect normal interactions. Be 
reasonable.

## Application

This Code of Conduct applies to all users and contributors who engage with the DoDevops project in any form.

## Expectations

* Politeness is expected at all times. Be kind and courteous.
* Always assume positive intent from others. Be aware that differences in culture and English proficiency make 
  written communication more difficult than face-to-face communication and that your interpretation of messages may 
  not be the one the author intended. Conversely, if someone asks you to rephrase something you said, be ready to do so 
  without feeling judged.
* Feedback is always welcome but keep your criticism constructive. We encourage you to open feature requests, bug 
  reports and pull requests. Use these forms to discuss improvements, not to vent out frustration. Similarly, when 
  other users offer you feedback please accept it gracefully. 

## Restricted conduct

Participating in restricted conduct will lead to a warning from project moderators and may lead to exclusion or reports
depending on the included platform.

* The DoDevops project is committed to providing a friendly and safe environment for everyone, regardless of level of
  experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, 
  ethnicity, language proficiency, age, political orientation, nationality, religion, or other similar characteristics.
  We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of participants in any form.
* In particular, we strive to be welcoming to all industry minorities and to ensure that they can take a more active 
  role in the community and the project. Targeted harassment of minorities is unacceptable.
* As a community developed project, we strive for consensus among contributors before moving forward with a proposed 
  feature. If there is not enough support for your ideas, please don't continue insisting or trying to force others
  into supporting your point. Features are not accepted through a voting process, so piling onto a contentious feature 
  requests is not acceptable.
* Aggressive or offensive behavior is not acceptable.
* You will be excluded from participating in the project if you insult, demean, harass, intentionally make others
  uncomfortable by any means, or participate in any other hateful conduct, either publicly or privately.
* Likewise, any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome and will 
  result in exclusion from the project.
* Any form of retaliation against a participant who contacts the Code of Conduct team is completely unacceptable,
  regardless of the outcome of the complaint. Any such behavior will result in exclusion from the community.
* For certainty, any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting is not
  acceptable.
